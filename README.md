# Payment Gateway API
Payment gateway API that allows a merchant to offer a way for their shoppers to pay for their product.

# Deliverables
1. Build an API that allows a merchant
  - To process a payment through your payment gateway.
  - To retrieve details of a previously made payment.
2. Build a simulator to mock the responses from the bank to test the API from your first deliverable. 

# Assumptions
1. Banks could be slow in processing requests or fail
2. The MerchantId is determined based on the API-Key passed into the request
3. CVV codes could be 3 or 4 digits (Amex)
